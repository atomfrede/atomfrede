### Hi there üëã

I'm Frederik and working mostly on [JHipster related stuff](https://github.com/jhipster/) if my wonderful üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ leaves some spare time.
Together with [Thorben](https://github.com/thjanssen) I organize the meetings of our local [Java User Group](https://github.com/jugpaderborn) in Paderborn.
