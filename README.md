Want your own awesome profile page? Check out [readme-scribe](https://github.com/muesli/readme-scribe) by [muesli](https://github.com/muesli)!

I'm Frederik and working mostly on [JHipster related stuff](https://github.com/jhipster/) if my wonderful 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 leaves some spare time.
Together with [Thorben](https://github.com/thjanssen) I organize the meetings of our local [Java User Group](https://github.com/jugpaderborn) in Paderborn.
